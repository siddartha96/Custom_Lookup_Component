# Project: Generic Custom Lookup component (Lightning Web Component)
# Purpose: 
          A reusable, configurable lookup component for Salesforce that works with any sObject and set of fields. Supports server-side searching via Apex, reactive parameters, 
          debounced user input, pagination (optional), and accessibility considerations.
